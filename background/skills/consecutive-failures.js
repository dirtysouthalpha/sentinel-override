      return `You have failed ${failureCount} consecutive steps. The pattern you're trying is not working. STOP and pick a fundamentally different approach:

1. **Step back from the page.** Use \`execute_js\` to inspect the page structure: \`{type:'execute_js', key:'page_struct', code:'return Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("main, [role=main], section, article, [class*=container]")).map(e=>({tag:e.tagName, cls:e.className.substring(0,80), text:e.innerText.substring(0,100)})).slice(0,15)'}\` — this gives you a structural map you can reason over.

2. **Check the network.** The data you want may be in an API response, not the DOM: \`{type:'read_network_requests', limit:30, filter:'json'}\`.

3. **Re-read the goal.** Is there a part you've been ignoring? Are you on the right URL for this step?

4. **Finish honestly.** You have ${stepsRemaining} steps remaining. If the remaining budget can't realistically complete the goal, call \`finish\` with what you've collected and clear "[MISSING DATA — X]" markers for the gaps. Better to ship a partial honest report than burn the budget flailing.

Do NOT repeat the action that just failed. The user can see the failure pattern in the activity stream and will judge progress by your next move.`;
