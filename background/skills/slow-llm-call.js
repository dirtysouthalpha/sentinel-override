// Fires when the most recent LLM call took > 25 seconds. Almost always
// means token bloat or provider slowness. Recovery is observability-focused:
// the engine has already capped per-step history result fields at 800 chars
// (v3.20.0), so the bloat is likely from the action.code or page content.
// This skill DOESN'T auto-apply — it nudges the LLM to emit a more focused
// next action (extract a specific key instead of dumping body text).

    return `Heads up: your last decision took ${sec} seconds. That's typically caused by prompt bloat. To keep the run moving:

- Prefer **focused extract / extract_list** (with a specific selector + key) over broad read_page on large pages.
- When using \`execute_js\`, scope the work tightly (one querySelector + one regex/slice) and keep \`code\` under ~300 chars. Long code in past history rides along in every subsequent prompt.
- Don't re-emit the same page-read commands repeatedly — past observations are already in your context.
- If the provider is genuinely slow (rate-limited / overloaded), wait it out — there's nothing the code can do about that.`;
